# Particle-Swarm-Sphere-Optimizer

This is a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based on the social behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling. The algorithm starts with a swarm of particles that iteratively explore and exploit the search space to find the optimal solution for the sphere function (3-dimensional in this demonstration). The particles update their velocities and positions based on their own best-known position and the global best position found by the swarm.
